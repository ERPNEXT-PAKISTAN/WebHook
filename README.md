Webhook Integration   

contains punctuation marks and special characters, often found on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Here's a breakdown of what each one is called:    

***Character	              Name***  
,	            Comma    
"	            Quotation mark (double quote)    
;	            Semicolon    
:	            Colon    
'             Apostrophe (single quote)    
`            	`   
\	            Backslash   
]	            Closing square bracket   
}	            Closing curly brace   
{	            Opening curly brace   
[            	Opening square bracket   
(	            Opening parenthesis   
)	            Closing parenthesis   
.	            Period or full stop   
/	            Forward slash or solidus   

If you're asking for a collective name for all of them, the most accurate term is special characters or punctuation symbols.    

Let me know if you're asking about them in a specific context (e.g. programming, regex, keyboard layout, etc.).
