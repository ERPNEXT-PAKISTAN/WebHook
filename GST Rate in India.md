What are GST Rates?
Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India is divided into five main slabs: 0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%.

0%: Essential items like fresh fruits, vegetables, and unbranded food grains
5%: Common necessities such as packaged food and public transport
12% & 18%: Standard goods and services like garments, electronics, and restaurants

Latest GST Slab Rates for Goods and Services in 2025
The GST system in India is designed with multiple GST slab rates (0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%) to ensure a fair and equitable tax structure. These GST slab rates account for the nature of the goods or services, their essentiality, and the income levels of the consumers. 

Essential items, such as food products, fall under lower GST slab rate, while luxury goods and services attract higher GST rates. This tiered approach helps balance revenue generation for the government while minimizing the tax burden on essential items for consumers.

HSN and SAC System in GST Tax Classification
The HSN and SAC are crucial for classifying goods and services under GST, helping determine applicable GST rates and ensuring compliance.

HSN System
The HSN (Harmonised System of Nomenclature) system, adopted by India in 1986, categorizes goods into 21 sections and 99 chapters, represented by six-digit codes, which can extend to eight digits for domestic use.

HSN Code Structure:

First two digits: Chapter number
Next two digits: Heading number
Next two digits: Subheading number
Last two digits: Further subheading number
For example, the HSN code for rice is 1006, which has a 5% GST rate. Errors in HSN codes can result in incorrect tax calculations and compliance issues. Here is a list of complete GST HSN code list.

SAC System
The SAC (Service Accounting Code) system classifies services under GST, developed by the CBEC, with 99 sections identified by two-digit codes.

SAC Code Structure:

First two digits: Section number
Next two digits: Chapter number
Next two digits: Heading number
Last two digits: Subheading number
Using the correct SAC codes is essential for determining GST rates and maintaining compliance.

Conclusion
The GST system is vital for consumers and businesses, making taxation easier by applying the same rates to goods and services. The GST has five different slabs, and some products may have extra cess. In 2024, the GST rates changed for some products, either increasing or decreasing them. These changes aimed to improve the tax system and boost the economy.
